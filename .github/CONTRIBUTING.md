## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use [semmantic commit](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to the style defined in the `.eslintrc.json` file.

### Tests Styleguide

- Fail tests first. How do you know if it is actually testing anything if the assert never failed?
- Treat `describe` as a noun or situation (Situations usually start with "when").
- Treat `it` as a statement about state or how an operation changes state. Usually, all `it` should start with "should".
- Prefer fewer asserts per `it`.

#### Example

```js
describe("a dog", () => {
  describe("when is happy", () => {
    it("should wags its tail", () => {
      expect(dog.tail.moving).to.be.true();
    });
  });
});
```
